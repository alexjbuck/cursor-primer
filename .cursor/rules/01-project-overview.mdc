# How to write slides

Split pages by horizontal ruler (`---`). It's very simple! :satisfied:

```markdown
# Slide 1

foobar

---

# Slide 2

foobar
```
````

## Development Workflow

1. Develop new code.
2. If appropriate, write tests.
3. Run tests locally.
4. Run linter, run in -fix mode if issues, manually resolve any remaining issues.
5. Commit changes if tests and linters pass.
6. CI/CD pipelines run tests and linters and manage deployments.


## Collaboration Guidelines

- Use descriptive branch names
- Create focused PRs with clear descriptions
- Follow the established code style
- Update documentation as needed
